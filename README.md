# Code Language Prediction

## Description
The Code Language Prediction project is designed to accurately identify and classify programming languages within a given code snippet. Leveraging advanced techniques, this tool not only determines the programming language used but also pinpoints the exact start and end coordinates (line and column numbers) of each identified language segment within the snippet. This precise detection capability makes it an invaluable tool for analyzing and processing code that contains multiple programming languages, enhancing understanding and streamlining workflows.

[WIP] Code and Models will be available soon.
